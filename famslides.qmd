# Slide 1: Introduction

Welcome to today's lesson on family relationships! In this lesson, we will:
- Read a family history story.
- Practice scanning and controlled exercises.
- Discuss a conversation activity.
- Explore an interactive family network diagram.
- Examine a dendrogram and hierarchy table to clarify the family tree.

# Slide 2: Family History Story

**The Roots**

Evelyn, the wise and gentle great-grandmother, was the heart of the family. She had two children: Margaret, a loving mother, and James, a warm-hearted uncle. Margaret, who was raised with care, grew up to be a devoted daughter and later became a nurturing mother herself. James, always full of energy, became a caring father to his only child, Michael, who grew up to be a friendly and curious young man.

**The Next Generation**

Margaret passed on her nurturing spirit to her two daughters, Joanne and Susan. Joanne, a dedicated mother, married her husband John and had three children: Peter, a cheerful boy; Lucy, a bright and curious daughter; and Kevin, her stepchild, who brought a unique energy to the family. Susan, who experienced a challenging period in her life, eventually divorced her ex-husband Mark. Despite these challenges, Susan remained a loving aunt and a devoted mother to her two daughters, Linda and Maria.

**Extended Bonds**

As the family grew, connections beyond the immediate generation enriched their lives. Michael, James’s son, became a cousin to Peter and Lucy, forging close ties with his aunt Joanne’s children. Linda, one of Susan’s daughters, was even regarded as a niece by Joanne due to the close bond between the sisters. Every relationship—whether marked by marriage, divorce, or step-relations—was celebrated as part of a diverse, evolving, and loving family history.

# Slide 3: Interactive Family Network Diagram

Below is the interactive family network diagram. You can zoom, pan, and hover over nodes to see details.

```r
# Load required packages
library(networkD3)
library(dplyr)
library(htmlwidgets)

# Define nodes (using zero-indexed IDs)
nodes <- data.frame(
  id = 0:12,
  name = c(
    "Evelyn\n(Great Grandmother)",  # 0
    "Margaret\n(Mother)",            # 1
    "James\n(Uncle)",                # 2
    "Joanne\n(Mother)",              # 3
    "Susan\n(Mother)",               # 4
    "Peter\n(Son)",                  # 5
    "Lucy\n(Daughter)",              # 6
    "Linda\n(Daughter)",             # 7
    "Maria\n(Daughter)",             # 8
    "Michael\n(Cousin)",             # 9
    "Kevin\n(Stepchild)",            # 10
    "John\n(Husband)",               # 11
    "Mark\n(Ex-husband)"             # 12
  ),
  generation = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3)
)

# Define vertical relationships (parent–child)
vertical_edges <- data.frame(
  source = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4),
  target = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 7, 8),
  relation = rep("child", 9)
)

# Connect James to Michael
vertical_edges <- bind_rows(vertical_edges,
  data.frame(source = 2, target = 9, relation = "child")
)

# Define horizontal relationships (siblings)
horizontal_edges <- data.frame(
  source = c(1, 5, 7, 3),
  target = c(2, 6, 8, 4),
  relation = c("sibling", "sibling", "sibling", "sibling")
)

# Define marriage/divorce relationships
marriage_edges <- data.frame(
  source = c(3, 4),
  target = c(11, 12),
  relation = c("married", "divorced")
)

# Additional relationships (cousin, niece)
additional_edges <- data.frame(
  source = c(9, 7),
  target = c(5, 3),
  relation = c("cousin", "niece")
)

# Combine all edges
links <- bind_rows(vertical_edges, horizontal_edges, marriage_edges, additional_edges)

# Create the force-directed network diagram
fn_plot <- forceNetwork(
  Links = links,
  Nodes = nodes,
  Source = "source",
  Target = "target",
  NodeID = "name",
  Group = "generation",
  opacity = 0.9,
  zoom = TRUE,
  fontSize = 14,
  linkDistance = 120,
  charge = -250,
  bounded = TRUE,
  opacityNoHover = 1
)

# Add custom styling for labels
fn_plot <- onRender(
  fn_plot,
  'function(el, x) {
    d3.selectAll(".node text")
      .style("background", "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)")
      .style("padding", "3px")
      .style("stroke", "black")
      .style("stroke-width", "0.5px")
      .style("border-radius", "3px")
      .attr("dy", ".35em")
      .attr("dx", "5");
  }'
)

fn_plot
```

# Slide 4: Dendrogram and Hierarchy Table

**Dendrogram of Family Hierarchy**

The dendrogram below is generated from the vertical (parent–child) relationships only, which helps clarify the generational structure.

```r
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a tidygraph object using only vertical edges
family_tree <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = vertical_edges, directed = TRUE)

# Plot the dendrogram
ggraph(family_tree, layout = 'dendrogram', circular = FALSE) +
  geom_edge_diagonal() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Family Hierarchy Dendrogram")
```

**Hierarchy Table**

Below is a table listing each family member and their generation.

```r
library(knitr)

# Order nodes by generation
hierarchy_table <- nodes[order(nodes$generation), c("name", "generation")]
kable(hierarchy_table, caption = "Family Hierarchy Table")
```

# Slide 5: Scanning Exercise
