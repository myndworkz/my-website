# Slide 1: Introduction

Welcome to today's lesson on family relationships! In this lesson, we will: - Read a family history story. - Practice scanning and controlled exercises. - Discuss a conversation activity.

# Slide 2: Family History Story

**The Roots**

Evelyn, the wise and gentle great-grandmother, was the heart of the family. She had two children: Margaret, a loving mother, and James, a warm-hearted uncle. Margaret, who was raised with care, grew up to be a devoted daughter and later became a nurturing mother herself. James, always full of energy, became a caring father to his only child, Michael, who grew up to be a friendly and curious young man.

**The Next Generation**

Margaret passed on her nurturing spirit to her two daughters, Joanne and Susan. Joanne, a dedicated mother, married her husband John and had three children: Peter, a cheerful boy; Lucy, a bright and curious daughter; and Kevin, her stepchild, who brought a unique energy to the family. Susan, who experienced a challenging period in her life, eventually divorced her ex-husband Mark. Despite these challenges, Susan remained a loving aunt and a devoted mother to her two daughters, Linda and Maria.

**Extended Bonds**

As the family grew, connections beyond the immediate generation enriched their lives. Michael, James’s son, became a cousin to Peter and Lucy, forging close ties with his aunt Joanne’s children. Linda, one of Susan’s daughters, was even regarded as a niece by Joanne due to the close bond between the sisters. Every relationship—whether marked by marriage, divorce, or step-relations—was celebrated as part of a diverse, evolving, and loving family history.
