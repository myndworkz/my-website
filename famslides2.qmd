## Slide 3: Family History Reading Text

**Family History**

Evelyn was a kind great‑grandmother. She had two children: Margaret and James. Margaret became a loving mother and cared well for her children. James was an active uncle and later became a caring father to his only child, Michael.

Margaret had two daughters. One daughter, Joanne, became a dedicated mother. She married her husband, John, and had three children: Peter, Lucy, and Kevin. Kevin was not her biological child but her stepchild. The other daughter, Susan, faced some difficulties and divorced her ex‑husband, Mark. However, she remained a caring mother to her two daughters, Linda and Maria.

Over time, the family grew closer. Michael, the son of James, became a cousin to Peter and Lucy. Linda was friendly and was sometimes called a niece by Joanne because they shared a close bond. Every member of the family was important, and every relationship was celebrated.
